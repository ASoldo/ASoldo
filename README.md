- 🐓 Hi, I’m Andrej "RootsterGG" Soldo, a software developer currently shaping the future of tech at RootsterGG. My journey has been rich and diverse, from game development to web full-stack, and I'm not done yet.

- 👀 I’m proficient in both frontend and backend programming, with a flair for languages like C, Go, Rust, and frameworks like Nuxt.js. I blend art and programming, having honed my skills as a technical artist in the gaming industry.

- 🌱 Continually expand my knowledge base and I’m currently learning and refining my expertise in GoLang and RustLang.

- 🤹‍♀️ My passion extends to both ends of the tech spectrum. On the frontend, I'm excited about Vue3/Nuxt3. On the backend, Go is my go-to. I also have a keen interest in the Unreal Engine 5 for next-gen gaming and visualizations.

- 💞 I'm open to collaborating on exciting projects that challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of what's possible in tech. I bring to the table a strong foundation in programming, touch typing, and a unique blend of artistic and technical skills.

- 📫 How to reach me: soldo.andrej@gmail.com

I'm always eager to connect and explore new opportunities in this ever-evolving tech landscape. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in bringing a passionate, experienced, and dedicated software developer onto your team.
